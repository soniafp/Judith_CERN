Development for CERN analysis team

Judith

Pixel particle detector testbeam analysis software. Currently under development.

To use, run `make` from the main directory and then run `bin/Judith -h` to see the program options. Building requires [`ROOT`](http://www.root.cern.ch/).

To build the documentation, you will need [Latex](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html). Then you can do: `cd doc/ && make` which will generate the `doc/reference.pdf`.
