### Configue analyzers below, used in loopers which generate results ###

# Cuts can be added to any analyzer, though some might not affect it. Their
# usage is illustrated below:
#
# cut [object] [variable] [type] : [value]
#
# value  : value of the cut
# type   : equal, max, min
# object : event, track, cluster, hit
# 
# Variables of each object:
# event   [hits, clusters, tracks, trigoffset]
# track   [clusters, chi2, originx, originy]
# cluster [hits, value, timing, posx, posy, matchdist]
# hit     [value, timing, posx, posy]
#
# Example: adding the following cuts to the efficiency will use tracks with
# 6 clusters and a maximal chi2 of 5:
#   cut track clusters equal: 6
#   cut track chi2 max: 5
#
# NOTE: cuts are applied by the analyzers. All tracks, clusters and hits used
# during analysis are first checked by the cuts. The event being analyzed
# must first pass the event cut. Some analyzers use both a reference and a
# DUT event. In this case, ONLY THE REFERENCE event is checked. Cuts are
# ONLY EVER APPLIED DURING BY AN ANALYZER, so they only impact analysis
# results.
#
# Some cuts are pre-defined by a looper and passed to an analyzer. For
# example, the fine aling looper uses only events with 1 full track
# when using the residual analyzer.
